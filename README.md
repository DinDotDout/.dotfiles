Personal system config, dotfiles and autmation scritps for hyprland.
Please bear in mind that these are for my personal use and they are not intended to work for everyone. You’re welcome to take a look, copy anything you like from them, or ask questions.
I’ve also incorporated many features that I’ve borrowed or adapted from other people, namely from ml4f dotfiles and others that I do not remember.
